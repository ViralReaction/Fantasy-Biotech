		<description>A bionic implant that allows direct control of constructs. Artificer links are used by soldiers to control war constructs, and by workers to control labor constructs. A person with the link is known as an artificer.\n\nArtificer links are self-installable. Pressed into the back of the throat, the unit injects itself through the flesh to clamp inside the base of the skull where it meets the spinal cord. There, it threads a web of ultrafine wires throughout nearby neuronal tissue to make the direct mental link between the user and the construct control band.\n\Artificer links are not simply devices for sending signals to constructs, because constructs are not merely robots. In addition to traditional computation, constructs have a dim psychic presence, so fluently controlling them requires a psychic connection. By linking artificer and construct both psychically and electromagnetically.\n\nSince the mechlink interlaces deep within the brain tissue, it can only be removed after death.\n\nNote: A mechanitor must be capable of smithing work to gestate mechanoids.</description>

		<description>A bionic implant that allows direct control of mechanoids. Mechlinks are used by soldiers to control war mechs, and by workers to control labor mechs. A person with a mechlink is known as a mechanitor.\n\nMechlinks are self-installable. Pressed into the back of the throat, the unit injects itself through the flesh to clamp inside the base of the skull where it meets the spinal cord. There, it threads a web of ultrafine wires throughout nearby neuronal tissue to make the direct mental link between the user and the mechanoid control band.\n\nMechlinks are not simply devices for sending radio signals to mechanoids, because mechanoids are not merely robots. In addition to traditional computers, mechanoids have a dim psychic presence, so fluently controlling them requires a psychic connection. By linking mechanitor and mechanoid both psychically and electromagnetically, the mechlink permits deeper control than screen-and-button interfaces.\n\nSince the mechlink interlaces deep within the brain tissue, it can only be removed after death.\n\nNote: A mechanitor must be capable of smithing work to gestate mechanoids.</description>
