		<label>basic dynamo core</label>
		<description>The simplest possible mechanoid brain, this is a tiny psychodynamic substrate unit housing a dull subpersona. Since this is only a basic-tier subcore, it can only drive the simplest of mechanoids.\n\nLike all mechanoid subcores, it contains a subpersona with a psychic presence, albeit a very faint one.</description>

		<label>standard dynamo core</label>
		<description>A standard-tier mechanoid brain, this is a psychodynamic substrate unit supporting a thinking subpersona. This particular subcore is strong enough to drive standard-tier mechanoids.\n\nMechanoids are more than robots, and this is more than a silicon computer. Its thinking, psychically-present subpersona makes it more adaptable than silicon systems. However, this also means it can only be produced by analog pattern transfer from another thinking mind.</description>

		<label>high dynamo core</label>
		<description>A high-tier mechanoid brain, this is a psychodynamic substrate unit which supports a sophisticated subpersona. This particular subcore is of the strongest tier, and can power complex ultra-heavy mechanoids.\n\nThe subpersona inside this core approaches a live human in its complexity, though it is of a very different nature. Like any such mind, it has a noticeable psychic presence.\n\nThis subcore could only have been produced by rich pattern transfer from another sophisticated mind. The only way to do this without huge facilities is to ripscan a living person's brain, killing them in the process.</description>
